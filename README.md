This is a health and fitness crowdfunding site that allows people to ask for sponsership for a variety of innovations, spanning wearable devices, smart fitness equipment, nutritional supplements, wellness apps, and more.

[x] Have a cool name, bonus points if it includes a pun and/or missing vowels. 

[x] Have a clear target audience.

[x] Have user accounts. A user should have at least the following attributes:
 
    [x] Username

    [x] Image
    [x] Target amount to fundraise
    [x] Whether it is currently open to accepting new supporters or not
    [x] When the project was created

[x] Ability to “pledge” to a project. A pledge should include at least the following attributes:

    [x] An amount
    [x] The project the pledge is for
    [x] The supporter/user (i.e. who created the pledge)
    [x] Whether the pledge is anonymous or not
    [x] A comment to go along with the pledge

[x] Implement suitable update/delete functionality, e.g. should a project owner be allowed to update a project description?

[x] Implement suitable permissions, e.g. who is allowed to delete a pledge?

[ ] Return the relevant status codes for both successful and unsuccessful requests to the API.

[ ] Handle failed requests gracefully (e.g. you should have a custom 404 page rather than the default error page).
